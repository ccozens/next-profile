This is this websitesite. My second website, and my first in any of Nextjs, Typescript, CSS: a deliberate choice for learning.  I have found the switch from React/JS to Next/TS a significant step in utility, especially in regards building more than just an SPA, and in TypeScript helping prevent compilation errors. I will continue in both for the timebeing to cement learning.
