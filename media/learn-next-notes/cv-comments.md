- scientific mindset
	- author of 19 scientific articles and holder of 3 patents
	- analytical approach: break down problems into smaller pieces
	- believe the data: there's no point carrying on if part 1 doesn't work
	
- creative problem solver
	- consistently conceived, designed and established novel methods throughout scientific career
	- completely reinvented how I work effectively in March 2020 in response to wfh enforced by UK covid lockdown when our first baby was 2 months old 
	- suggested an unhappy team member moved to a team more suited to their interests, where they flourished
	
- team player
	- seek consensus and feedback on proposals both when working as lead and IC
	- championed integration of data and lab scientists at LabGenius
	- sought out collaborators with relevant skills and established scientific collaborations within and outside my own research department, leading to multple joint first author publications
	
- leader
	- coordinated and managed a team of 4 scientists at LabGenius
	- conceived and shared team vision, empowering team members to work independently with clarity and unity of purpose
	- ensured team members received appropriate praise for projects, while I took responsibility if the team did not deliver
	
- clear communicator
	- data-centred proposals and reports
	- conflict resolution through open conversation
	- concise, audience-appropriate language
	
- learner
	- continuous learning is essential in science: innovation is constant and better, easier, more powerful methods come out all the time. I learnt this as a lab scientist: it applies to everything.
	- I joined LabGenius knowning nothing about leading teams or machine learning. After a year I was leading a team responsible for generating data for ML models.
	- reading about how to work and think has transformed my working and leadership styles (eg Essentialism, Think Again, Start With Why, Date To Lead).
	
- self-motivated
	- conceived, designed, carried out and published entire scientific projects with minimal oversight ( https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/46/8/e51/4835052 )
	- moved from Senior Scientist to Team Lead at LabGenius when I approached CEO and made my case for promotion
	- 80:20 - it is better to finish a project that works robustly than to perfect some parts and leave others undone
