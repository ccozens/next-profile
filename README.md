## Profile site with NEXTjs and CSS

### Purpose
- showcase that I can build websites
- repository for work I want to share
- learning arena

### About
This is this my second website. I switched from CRA to NEXTjs and from JavaScript to Typescript as a learning experience in more robust technologies, and from Tailwind to CSS to improve my understanding of native CSS. I have found the switch from React/JS to Next/TS a significant step in utility, especially in regards building more than just an SPA, and in TypeScript helping prevent compilation errors. I will continue in both for the timebeing to cement learning.

### Rough edges
This site isn't perfect. To that: I know!  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. This is my first NEXTjs site, my first TypeScript project, my second website. I'm taking courses in [Typescript](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-typescript) and [UI/UX design](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/intro-to-ui-ux) as I go. This isn't an excuse. It's a statement that I'm a learner. I'm keen for feedback, so please [shoot me an email](mailto: officechrisgarden@gmail.com) with comments/suggestions.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. As this is a personal project there's no feedback loop. In general, I'm aiming to apply [80:20](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kevinkruse/2016/03/07/80-20-rule/) - which in my interpretation means "its better to have a functional site with all pages and components complete, than 2/3 of the components perfect and the remainder not functional".  

In other words: I'll perfect it in due course, as I receive feedback and apply new learning. For now, I'm stoked that its up and running less than 6 months after I started learning HTML.
