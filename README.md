# Profile site with NEXTjs and CSS

## Purpose
- showcase that I can build websites
- repository for work I want to share
- practice ground

## About
This is this my second website. I switched from CRA to NEXT.js and from JavaScript to Typescript as a learning experience in more robust technologies, and from Tailwind to CSS to improve my understanding of native CSS. I have found the switch from React/JS to Next/TS a significant step in utility, especially in regards building more than just an SPA, and in TypeScript helping prevent compilation errors. I will continue in both for the timebeing to cement learning.
